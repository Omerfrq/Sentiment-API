Unfortunately, in a movie with [consults abacus] 40 characters, not everyone can be front and center. The Avenger Formerly Known as Captain America (Chris Evans) makes the most of his limited screen time, as does this year's (so far) reigning box office monarch, Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman). Mostly, this surfeit of superheroes forces us to enjoy the little things: Drax's borderline erotic descriptions of Thor, Tony Stark's fatherly interactions with Peter Parker, Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) teaming up with Okoye (Danai Gurira) against Proxima Midnight (Carrie Coon). But even in a movie that's almost as long as a typical MLB game, sacrifices must be made.

Less easily justified are a handful of crucially puzzling decisions made by several of the protagonists with regard to those Stones not yet in Thanos' grasp. Where more pragmatic heads might have prevailed in the face of the deaths of untold trillions, others fall back on "you never leave a serum-augmented/cybernetic/otherwise enhanced man behind," with predictable results.

Still, the massive scope and ambition of Avengers: Infinity War put us in a forgiving mood. The big question is: who's left standing at the end? Ha ha, we're not falling for that one again, though suffice to say Avengers: Infinity War is as much about sacrifice as fisticuffs, and is as close an analog to The Empire Strikes Back as we're likely to get from the MCU. It's the sprawling culmination of a decade's worth of world-building as much it is a vehicle designed to ensure your butts are in your seats for the sequel. In both senses, for the most part, it delivers.
